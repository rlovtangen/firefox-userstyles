= Firefox userstyles

My user userstyles for Firefox. Used mainly to hide unimportant stuff I don't care about.

== Location
On Mac OS X `userContent.css` should be placed under `~/Library/Application Support/Firefox/Profiles/<profileid>.default/chrome/`

== Reference
http://kb.mozillazine.org/UserContent.css
